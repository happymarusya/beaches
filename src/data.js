        description: "The word 'Seychelles' conjures the very image of a dreamy, far-flung paradise. Luckily, the Seychelles reality every bit measures up to the fantasy, with exquisite beaches, intensely green nature reserves, and majestic wildlife at every turn. Anse Source D'Agent exemplifies the unique Seychellois beach formula, defined by a translucent lagoon perfect for snorkeling and wavy granite boulders that seem tossed onto the shore by ancient giants.",

Matira Beach gets an honorable mention for its size, cleanliness, easy access, and incredible beauty — picture fluffy white sand, calm turquoise water as far as the eye can see, and lush volcanic hills peaking in the distance. Matira is Bora Bora's biggest public beach, yet its scene is mellow and subdued. Beachgoers are usually napping on towels, wading in the knee-deep water, or visiting the beach's boutiques and affordable cafes.",

        description: "Navagio beach is an isolated yet strikingly beautiful sandy cove on the Greek island of Zakynthos. It is often referred to as the Shipwreck Beach because it is home to the wreck of a ship called Panagiotis that is believed to have been a smugglers ship. The area is defined by its sheer limestone cliffs, white sand beaches, and clear blue water, which attract thousands of tourists yearly. The strip of beach is accessed only by boat, but you can see it from above if you stand on the high side of the surrounding cliffs.",

This may be one of the most popular beaches in the world, but there's plenty of room for everyone — between Grace Bay and neighboring Leeward and Bight beaches, visitors have seven continuous miles of beach to explore.",

Le Morne is particularly noteworthy for its two-and-a-half miles of sugar-soft sand (beaches in Mauritius are often rough with broken-up coral) densely lined with palm and pine-like filao trees. The sheltered lagoon waters stretch to the horizon and the kitesurfing conditions are perhaps the best in the world. For dramatic effect, the nearby Le Morne Mountain looms large.",

Thailand’s Department of National Parks, Wildlife and Plant Conservation closed the beach for four months in 2018 for reef recovery, and, since reopening, it’s been capped at 2,000 visitors a day, making it, perhaps, the world’s most famous beach. Those who make the cut can ogle the famous sugar sand and 300-foot cliffs in person. The neighboring island of Phi Phi Don holds the Phi Phi Islands’ only accommodations, including Zeavola’s rustic-chic suites.",

Accessible only by boat, seaplane, or helicopter, it serves up seven-kilometers of glittering white silica sand backed by turquoise water. The beach is on Whitsunday Island, which is the largest of the 74 islands that make up the group by the same name. When the water shifts its depth, the colors of blue change and swirl around the sand. It is a stunning sight.",

When the sunset chasers arrive, pack your tote and follow the scrubby footpath 30-minutes south to even more secluded Sandy Bay.",
